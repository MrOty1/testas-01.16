                    <h1>Great Wall of China (China)</h1>
                    <p>The Great Wall of China, stretching over 13,000 miles, is one of humanity’s most ambitious architectural endeavors. Initially constructed to protect the Chinese states from invading nomadic tribes, its history spans millennia, with early sections dating back to the 7th century BC.<br>
                    <p>The wall as we see it today was primarily built during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), using advanced techniques for its time. It includes beacon towers for communication, watchtowers for surveillance, and fortresses for defense. Built from stone, tamped earth, and bricks, its design adapted to diverse terrains, from rugged mountains to arid deserts.<br>
                    <p>Key sections like Badaling and Mutianyu showcase the wall’s intricate design and strategic importance. The Great Wall wasn’t just a military fortification it also served as a means of trade, cultural exchange, and control over the Silk Road. Over 2,000 years of history are encapsulated in its construction, making it a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most visited landmarks in the world.<br>
                    <p>Beyond its historical significance, the wall symbolizes perseverance and human ingenuity, drawing millions of visitors annually. Walking along its stretches is a journey through time, offering breathtaking views and a deep sense of connection to the past.<br>
